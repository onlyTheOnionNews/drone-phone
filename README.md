# Drone Phone - Drone Reuse Project

This project aims to allow older drones to be renovated to meet broadcasting requirements without expensive Remote ID modules. This can prevent good equipment from going to waste and support basic, low-range flights for filming and testing purposes. Drones should be tested for compliance by pilots before attemtping to launch using software or hardware related to this project.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Generate native code

  ### Android + IOS
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --platform all
   ```

   ### Android
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --platform android
   ```

   ### IOS
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --platform ios
   ```

4. Link libraries

   ```bash
   cd android
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   cd ios
   ```

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
